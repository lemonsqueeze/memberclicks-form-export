*** By default greasemonkey userscripts don't run on local files ! ***
To be able to test on local files you need to:
- open 'about:config' in firefox and set
  extensions.greasemonkey.fileIsGreaseable  to true
- in greasemonkey preferences for the script, edit it and insert a
    // @include  file://*
  directive at the top

now you should be able to test locally.
