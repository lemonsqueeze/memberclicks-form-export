*** By default greasemonkey userscripts don't run on local files ! ***
To be able to test on local files you need to:
- open 'about:config' in firefox and set
  extensions.greasemonkey.fileIsGreaseable  to true
- in greasemonkey preferences for the script -> User Settings -> Included pages, add
     file://*
and you should be able to test locally.
